# game_scooby_math

Here is a little game I made with Javascript and displayed with HTML & CSS.
This family game allows you to try some maths. You can enter your values and get in return the average, the variance or even the standard deviation.
Some additional maths are available.
Though, you can play a dice game based on different cartoons.
The first one to reach a specific score wins.
Each time a dice is rolled, you can wether hold the score or roll the dice again in order to increase your score.
Of course, if you roll twice multiple times the dice you can lose all your points won previously.

Let's play !

3. DICE GAME PART
Here is the dice "SCOOBY DOO" game.
Each time you roll the dice, a random score linked with the character is added to the current score.
You have 2 options:
    - ROLL AGAIN => EARN A BETTER SCORE IN ONE SHOT
    - HOLD => LET THE OPPONENT PLAY (FICTIONAL OPPONENT)
 
IF YOU HAVE A CERTAIN SCORE YOU WIN THE GAME ! 
BE CAREFUL THOUGH, FOR INSTANCE IF YOU FALL ON A GHOST YOU LOSE POINTS....
