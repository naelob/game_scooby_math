# game_scooby_math

Here is a little game I made with Javascript and displayed with HTML & CSS.
This family game allows you to try some maths. You can enter your values and get in return the average, the variance or even the standard deviation.
Some additional maths are available.
Though, you can play a dice game based on different cartoons.
The first one to reach a speicfic score wins.
Each time a dice is rolled, you can wether hold the score or try to roll the dice again in order to increase your score.
Of course, you can lose all your points won previously.

Let's play !
